                <h3>My Sports Journey: From Taekwondo to Volleyball Leadership</h3>
                <p><strong>Early Beginnings: Taekwondo at Four</strong></p>
                <p>My introduction to sports started at the tender age of four when my eldest sister encouraged me to take taekwondo lessons. 
                    It was a new world for me—full of discipline and energy. However, by the time I reached second grade, I had to stop. 
                    My father wanted me to prioritize my studies, and with their busy work schedules, it became difficult for my parents to take me regularly to the classes. 
                    Though brief, those early years in taekwondo laid the groundwork for my love of physical activity.</p>

                <p><strong>Discovering Volleyball: A New Passion</strong></p>
                <p>In third grade, I found myself stepping into the world of volleyball. 
                    My third eldest sister was a varsity player and captain of the women’s volleyball team at Benguet State University during her time. 
                    She would often bring me along to her team’s training sessions. I was mesmerized by the tall, skilled athletes, and they welcomed me warmly, teaching me how to receive during their breaks. 
                    Their camaraderie and skill inspired me deeply—I dreamed of being just as tall and strong as they were.</p>

                <p><b>Taking Lead in Elementary School</b></p>
                <p>By sixth grade (2018-2019), I decided to join the volleyball team at my elementary school. 
                    It was a proud moment when I became the captain, leading our team with dedication and enthusiasm. 
                    We competed at the provincial level, an incredible experience that tested my skills and teamwork. 
                    Unfortunately, I sustained an injury during the competition, which was a tough setback but also a lesson in perseverance.</p>

                <p><b>High School Volleyball and Overcoming Challenges</b></p>
                <p>When I entered seventh grade, I tried out for the women's volleyball team at my high school, Tublay School of Home Industries. 
                    Making the team was a huge milestone, and we even qualified to play at the provincial level. 
                    However, the outbreak of COVID-19 halted our plans and paused many sports activities until I reached ninth grade.</p>

                <p>Determined not to let anything stop me, I returned to the volleyball court in tenth grade. 
                    I continued playing through to twelfth grade, competing at the provincial level and growing stronger with each game. 
                    Volleyball has become more than a sport for me—it’s a way to connect, lead, and push beyond my limits.</p>

                <h2>Reflections</h2>
                <p>Looking back, my sports journey has been a blend of early starts, family inspiration, setbacks, and perseverance. 
                    From the first kicks in taekwondo to leading volleyball teams through school, each chapter has contributed to who I am today. 
                    I’m grateful for the support of my sisters and family, the lessons learned from injuries, and the joy of playing the game I love.</p>

                <p>What’s next? I’m excited to continue this journey, wherever it leads—whether on the court or beyond. Sports have taught me that with passion and resilience, the possibilities are endless.</p>
